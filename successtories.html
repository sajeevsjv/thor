                    but actually
                    forcing me to figure it out on my own, by pointing me in all the right directions in order to
                    complete
                    them. That helped me dig deeper into various important topics, which then gave me the necessary
                    knowledge and confidence to start applying for jobs and landing that dream job. The community was
                    part
                    of it too, first getting help and then helping, it was a great way to learn and make it stick.

                    almost exactly a year of working through the program, I was offered a job as a front end web
                    developer.<br><br>

                    Odin taught me all the most crucial skills in webdev and gave me an incredibly strong foundation for
                    branching out and learning other pieces of the web-dev puzzle along the way.

                    programming on the web! It was an invaluable resource on my path to a becoming a software
                    developer.<br><br>

                    Thanks to The Odin Project I was able to get a job half way through the curriculum, and the projects
                    completed as part of the curriculum gave me an edge compared to other junior developers with no
                    experience.

                    from topic to topic then trying to piece things together as I went.<br><br>

                    Having this online curriculum to follow was a massive help and took my understanding of programming
                    to the next level. Being self taught and going into a job interview with no professional experience
                    is incredibly daunting, but being able to point to my GitHub which had all of the projects I'd
                    completed while going through the curriculum, I was able to demonstrate that I was committed to
                    learning and improving myself, ultimately that's exactly what they were after in an
                    employee.<br><br>
                    If you're considering using The Odin Project I really cannot recommend it enough, I owe my career to
                    this site.

                <p class="pt-4">In 2014 I wanted to learn how to program, but I had no idea where to start. Odin solved
                    that problem for me - it mapped out a series of lesson plans that showed me what to study, without
                    holding my hand or spoon-feeding me information.<br><br>

                    The curriculum requires hard work and perseverance, but it's worth it. I walked into my first job
                    and felt instantly comfortable with the tools and technologies my employer required. Yes, there was
                    a lot that I didn't know yet, but having done Odin also gave me the confidence to pick up new skills
                    as needed.

                    confidently learn at my own pace and taught me how to approach and solve real-life programming
                    problems.<br><br>

                    The projects in TOP were a perfect mix of difficulty, allowing me to gain exposure to different
                    technologies and feel challenged without feeling overwhelmed. Because of the foundation TOP
                    provided, I was able to easily transition into freelancing and then into a junior level Rails
                    developer position.

                <p class="pt-4"> I remember when I first tried to learn to code. It's not an accident that I say I tried
                    because if I'm honest, I started a few times before finally sticking to it. I tried many different
                    resources, courses, and curriculums, but none of them seemed to teach in a way that made me stick to
                    it.<br><br>
                    What differentiates TOP from all those other courses and curriculums out there is its unique way of
                    providing guidance and answers to the most important questions, while also strengthening your
                    ability to push through the curriculum and projects by yourself and as a result grow on your
                    struggles.<br><br>
                    The reason why TOP was perfect for me was on the one hand because in its' well-structured paths I
                    found answers to the most difficult of all questions: Where should I start? What should I learn
                    first? How well do I have to know certain technologies? Besides providing answers to those
                    questions, having a great and supportive community, another point to stress is the flexibility of
                    the curriculum.<br><br>

                    I was able to use my creativity to design and code the projects, and often further ideas were
                    provided to help you figure out which feature to add next. Now, I reached what I wouldn't have
                    thought possible when I started. I landed a job :D.

                <p class="pt-4"> Before I found TOP, I was jumping from course to course without really any guidance or
                    community. I wanted to get a real development job and not operating an IT help desk, and I wanted to
                    do it for free.<br><br>

                    After reading people's success stories on Reddit on how they found a development job, many people
                    praised the curriculum at TOP and how they got a job even before they finished it. I couldn’t
                    believe it! So I decided to give it a shot.<br><br>

                    The self-paced structure, reading materials, and challenges was easy to understand and made me feel
                    I was in control. I was even able to find a community to help guide and mentor me through the
                    process. About eight months after I started, I got my first development gig - and I didn't even
                    finish the curriculum! Because of TOP, I can call myself a developer.

                <p class="pt-4"> The Odin Project changed my life and that is not an understatement. In November 2013, I
                    made a commitment to myself to become a self-taught developer so I threw myself head first into
                    Google trying to learn everything I could.<br><br>

                    Originally, I wanted to be a Java Web Developer then a week later I wanted to be an Android
                    developer. I was reading blog post after blog post, and pretty soon I started to get overwhelmed. I
                    had no structure and no plan of attack about how to get a development job.<br><br>

                    I was desperate to change career and then suddenly I stumbled across The Odin Project, and it had
                    exactly what I needed. An exact path to take to become a Software Developer. It was like taking a
                    college course except it was free and in my own time.<br><br>

                    I started going through the course, and by June 2015 I got my first development job. Exactly 14
                    months after I started The Odin Project. I never had to quit my job, and I always had something to
                    look forward to in the evening.
